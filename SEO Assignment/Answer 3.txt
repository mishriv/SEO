Meta tags are HTML elements that provide metadata about a web page. While some meta tags are used for technical purposes, others have a direct impact on how 
search engines and social media platforms display and understand your content. 

Here are several benefits of using meta tags:

1-Improved Search Engine Optimization (SEO):

  Title Tag: The <title> tag is one of the most important on-page SEO elements. It defines the title of the web page, which is displayed in search engine results.
  A well-optimized title can improve click-through rates and search engine rankings.

  Meta Description: The <meta name="description"> tag provides a concise summary of the webpage's content. It can influence whether users click on your link in search results,
  making it essential for SEO.

2-Enhanced Click-Through Rates (CTR): A well-crafted title and meta description can entice users to click on your link in search results, increasing your CTR. 
  This can lead to more organic traffic.

3-Better User Experience: Some meta tags, such as <meta name="viewport">, <meta charset>, and <meta name="author">, contribute to the overall user experience by 
ensuring proper rendering and compatibility across devices and browsers.

4-Social Media Sharing: Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags (<meta property="og:..."> and <meta name="twitter:...">) allow you to control how your content appears when
shared on social media platforms. You can specify the title, description, image, and other elements, making your content more attractive and shareable.

5-Structured Data and Rich Snippets: Meta tags such as <meta name="keywords"> and structured data (e.g., Schema.org markup) help search engines understand the content 
and context of your page. This can result in rich snippets in search results, displaying additional information like ratings, reviews, and event details.
